      "### Characterization of Developers: The Onion Model\n",
      "\n",
      "A common way to characterize developers in open source communities is the so called \"onion model\". This is based on the total amount of commits done by each of the developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This example uses a specific characterization of developers that follows the 80%-20%. This means that around a 80% of the total activity in a repository is done by a 20% of the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers are divided into core, regular and ocassional:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Core developers are defined as those doing up to a 80% of the total commits\n",
      "* Regular developers are defind as those doing from the 80% to a 99% of the total commits\n",
      "* Occasional developers are defined as those doing from the 99% to the 100% of the commits\n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis is partially based on the study by Crowston and Howison: 'The social structure of free and open source software'\n",
