      "Libre software communities are about people. People with a common mission to accomplish specific goals. Developers, maintainers, designers, lawyers and a long list of roles that help libre software communities to reach their goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all of these members use a common infrastructure, in most of the cases opened to third parties, that aims at attracting more and more people to participate with them. Indeed transparency is an important fact of libre software communities, where all of the information is public to anyone interested in the project. \n",

      "There are several options to measure basic activity. OpenHub or the basic GitHub metrics are some examples. However, there are usual limitations in the retrieval process given by the API and limitations in how to use the retrieved datasets. In addition, those analysis are only focused on versioning systems or at most adding information from ticketing systems.\n",

      "However, it is possible to analyze a lot of more data sources offered by open source projects: mailing lists, code review systems or asynchronous channels of communication are some examples.\n",
